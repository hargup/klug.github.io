# klug.github.io website

How to make changes to the website, and get it merged into upstream:

1. Fork the project on GitHub, so that you have your own copy of the
project to play with.

2. Make the changes that you want and split the changes up into
logical commits.  Don't forget to signoff on them.

3. Please read and try to follow
[Documentation/SubmittingPatches](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches).
Since 'git-send-email' will not work from behind a restrictive
firewall, either send one of the website maintainers an email with the
patches attached, or send a "Pull Request" on GitHub if there are >10
commits.

4.  Alternatively, if you think the changes will impact KLUG
siginificantly, or you feel that your changes require discussion,
please post the patches to the mailing list.

5. The website maintainers will download the patches from their email
inboxes, and apply them with git-am.  They might choose to make minor
changes or drop a few patches before pushing them to upstream.  They
will reply to your email with a rationale if necessary.  Please pull
the latest code from upstream to see your commits.

Thanks, and enjoy contributing!
